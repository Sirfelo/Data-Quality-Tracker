Data quality is the measure of how well suited a data set is to serve its specific purpose. Data quality is the measure of how well suited a data set is to serve its specific purpose. Measures of data quality are based on data quality characteristics such as accuracy, completeness, consistency, validity, uniqueness, and timeliness.Data that is deemed fit for its intended purpose is considered high quality data.By which metrics do we measure data quality? There are six main dimensions of data quality: accuracy, completeness, consistency, validity, uniqueness, and timeliness. 

Accuracy: The data should reflect actual, real-world scenarios; the measure of accuracy can be confirmed with a verifiable source.
Completeness: Completeness is a measure of the dataâ€™s ability to effectively deliver all the required values that are available.
Consistency: Data consistency refers to the  uniformity of data as it moves across networks and applications. The same data values stored in difference locations should not conflict with one another.  
Validity: Data should be collected according to defined business rules and parameters, and should conform to the right format and fall within the right range.   
Uniqueness: Uniqueness ensures there are no duplications or overlapping of values across all data sets. Data cleansing and deduplication can help remedy a low uniqueness score.
Timeliness: Timely data is data that is available when it is required. Data may be updated in real time to ensure that it is readily available and accessible.
